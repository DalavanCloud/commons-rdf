# Commons RDF

Working repository for experimenting with idea of providing a commons library for [RDF 1.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/) that could be implemented by teh new version of the Java libraries: [Jena](http://jena.apache.org) 3.0 and [Sesame](http://openrdf.callimachus.net) 4.0.

## Status

This library is still work in progress. From the very beginning it is using a package from [Apache Commons](http://commons.apache.org) without permission. That's because at some point we would like to submit it there, so we would like to avoid naming issues on such migration.
