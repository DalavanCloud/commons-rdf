# Commons RDF

Working repository for experimenting with idea of providing a commons library for [RDF 1.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/) that could be implemented by the upcoming versions of the main Java toolkits ([Jena](http://jena.apache.org) 3.0 and [Sesame](http://openrdf.callimachus.net) 4.0) as well as wrappers for other JVM languages ([Banana RDF](https://github.com/w3c/banana-rdf) and so on).

The main motivation behind this simple library is revise an historical incompatibility issue. This library does not pretend to be a generic api wrapping those libraries, but a set of interfaces for the RDF 1.1 concepts. In the initial phase just about the core concepts (URI/IRI, Resource, Blank Node, Literal, etc). And then we may extend it to triples/quads/statements or even graphs/models, but that's something we'll see.

## Status

This library is still work in progress. From the very beginning it is using a package from [Apache Commons](http://commons.apache.org) without permission. That's because at some point we would like to submit it there, so we would like to avoid naming issues on such migration.
